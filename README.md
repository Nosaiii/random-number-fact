# Random Number Fact
A flask web app in which you can ask for a fun trivia fact about a specific number and have it displayed on your screen.

## Why?
Boredom.

## Installation
To get this Flask project yourself, you will first have to follow a small amount of steps to get it all up and running.

### Requisites
- Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- A program to write Python code in *(any Python-supported IDEA, Notepad++, Sublime Text, etc)*
- An installation of Git, to clone this repository locally

### Installation steps
First, open up your command prompt and locate to a folder you wish to clone the repository to. After that, run the following command to clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Nosaiii/random-number-fact
```

Then, locate yourself to the root folder of the project. From there, create a new Python virtual environment, activate it and install the pip dependencies by doing like such:
```shell
# Create a new virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# (UNIX):
source venv/bin/activate
# (Windows):
./venv/Scripts/activate

# Install PIP dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now your project has all that it needs to start developing and running it.
